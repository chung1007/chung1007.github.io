		<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>
				I was born in South Korea, and grew up in the small town of Cheongju. When I was 6, turning 7, my family moved to
				Australia, Perth, where we would live the next six and a half years of our lives. I thought I would live the rest of my life amongst the black swans,
				the pelicans, the Aussies. However, when I turned 12, my family made another life transition to America. California has a special place in my heart. It
				is where I attended Junior High School, remembering how awstruck I was at the whole 7 periods and personal locker system first time. It is where I graudated High School, being part of a life changing robotics team that made me fall in love with the career path I have now chosen. It is where I got my first car license, my first prom date, and my first heartbreaking goodbye. I live in Maryland now, still happy to have a home and have a convenient trip back home from Tufts University.
